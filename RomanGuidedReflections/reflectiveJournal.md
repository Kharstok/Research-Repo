# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
    Scratch is a visual programing language developed by MIT (Massachussets Institute of Technology) it was initially aimed at school children but it looks as though it has been adopted by all ages 
### What is visual programming?
    Visual programming is when the creation/coding process is done through a GUI that enables the user to represent things visually, scratchs coding 'blocks' are an example. Wordpress could be considered visual programming software when compared to writing raw html or css.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
    Im not sure if im interpreting the question right but by programming principals are we talking about rules or guidelines to consider? if true then I list them below.

    1. Keep it Simple, Stupid
        * Code should be easily read and easy to maintain in the future, if its unnecesarily complex consdier breaking things into smaller chunks of code or investigating if some elements are unnecessary and able to be removed.

    2. Contents for Context
        * In level 4 web design I frequently ran into issues with naming classes too similarly as well as loosing track of a growing number of containers. I began thinking of the HTML and CSSS code I was writing as a contents page at the front of a book. Thinking in this context helped me to write code as if it were going from chapter to section, subsection and what page im on.

    3. Comments on Deletion
        * Rather than delete code, wether its to try an alternative or because its not working, comment it out first and keep it commented out until the issue is resolving or the goal reached. Doing this means there is something to fall back on if the alternative didnt work, you will always have something to reference and 'debug'
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
    I made [this one](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717573899/) in class. Its a bit rough, theres no win condition but im happy with what I could do with Sratch. I thought it was a bit too simple but I enjoyed the challenge of converting functions i know in python into something I can use with Scratch. This [generator project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/416842874/) that I found completely debunked my assumptions on scratch

## Week 2:

### What is git?
    Git is a version control system. Git thinks about the data it stores as a series of snapshots which is apprently different to to other VCSs which stores information as files and on changes made to those files over time
### What is GitHub?
    Github is a web hosting service for version control with Git, a software development tool and a community for developers to share and build upon projects by both themselves and others

## Romans Finalising Prompts

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I did take regular breaks but could have done with more perhaps. Sometimes I found myself staring at the screen with so many avenues I wanted to take that I was 'frozen' for a time and unproductive, breaks may have helped but I think my mind was too busy to feel properly rested and ready. 
Yes. I stretched often and remained aware of healthy posture and positioning. When working on the ships I was told in training that "the best position is the next position" meaning movement and variety is a big part of reducing muscle aches and pains.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
I assume this is when you give yourself allocated time frames for work and breaks like 1hrs work 10min break or 2hrs work 20min or similar. I didnt use this and dont foresee myself using it until im knowledgeable enough to be able to make enough stpes forward in one setting to be able to have an empty mind when breaking.
Correction. I looked it up. Yes, I did use timeboxing, setting myself timeframes for certain portions of work, I used this in technical support where I knew enough to be able to work uninterrupted but I didnt use this for software development as I dont know enough and so am frequently interrupted with having to educate myself on things before carrying on work.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
Each as in both tech support and software dev?
Tech support: 5
- The task was reletaviely clear and I think i have met all learning outcomes as well as being happy with the result so far, being 90% writing its also an area that im generally quite confident in
Software Dev: 3
- I have good skills in reflection and analysis but still struggle on the application, I struggle with a fear of failiure particularly with creative pursuits. I understand that for this failure is a part of learning but I want to make sure I submit something im proud of, if all i submit is code for a simple program when I know a more complex one is in reach I would be dissapointed .  At the momeent I know I need to find some balance between in my though that "ild rather hand in incomplete work for a complex program I can take pride in, than hand in a simple program that ticks all the boxes but I cant place value in"

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
How quickly im able to interpret code in fornt of me and how far my written reflective skills have come since last they were used. Im also proud of not having bet myself up over much and maintaining a good headspace

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
My stratergy from the start and with influence from Neri Oxmans work has been to gather knowledge it, apply it, be inspired by it, apply it. This has partially worked out, the first part of applying it ive done by following along tutorials interpreting the code finding and fixing erorrs and then playing with the output before thinking on / reflecting on possible ways it might be adapted and changed. The final apply stage I ahvnt been so good at as I havnt written much of my own code except in the context of fixing errors or problems and slightly changing the output, im aiming in this last week to write my own code as practice for applying the whole lot in the final project


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Set a day aside each week for actual practice in writing your own code involving at least one function/keyword/operator from code youve been inspired by

### What is Python?
Python is an OOP language with a wide range of uses and applications 

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
Excessively so

### Have you meditated before?
I have, I dont find in helpful. Meditative states can come naturally to me but otherwise if im busy, stressed, theres alot going on or needing to be done I find myself just getting frustrated that the time spent meditating isnt pushing anything further to completion or contentment

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Most of my mastery is in understanding myself, navigating mental health, recognising and striving towards meaningful goals. For those it took a lot of quiet space and introspection but I Discipline is the most transferrable method

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Yes but not in a 'ill put this on my CV' sense

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes to all, massively so. For learning to think logically.. I dont think so for me personally, I like to think, and hope that im right in thinking, that im well balanced between logic and creative thinking but I do find that creative or just visual tools help me to connect the dots for more logic based thinking in the future

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
89..
- 51 on the computer. 10 for tools like word, excell, sharepoint, email. 3 are distractions the rest are for study)
- 38 on my phone. 14 are just open because I havnt saved them yet.. recipes etc. The others are study related with a majority mentally labelled as not yet relevant and will be read later

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Yes, trying to incorporate thigns like github and processing into VScode has been frustrating, walking away then coming back to it solves most issues. It feels like.. my intrest in the sound of glass breaking sky rockets.

### What is an IDE?
Integrated Development Enviroment, like VScode I think. I struggle sometimes with understanding the difference between IDE, Framework and various descriptions of Editors

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
How some of the clasmates respond to scenarios like this and how they interact with different people. Im not sure I udnerstood what it means in the context of agile practice but it was interesting seeing how everyone operates in that kind of enviroment, who might be leader types, who work well as support type people and who arnt really open to contributing as well as assumptions on what everyone motives or reasons might be behind those mindsets

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
Not many people leapt up to organise themselves into teams or divy up the spaghetti, so I did it, I counted at the spaghetti then when people started asking the room whos in what team I said everyone on my left is a team (because there was already the right number of people) and everyone on my right can split into two and it pretty much worked out that way

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Initially it was finding some kind of path for the repo and I think im happy that I addressed that in the second or third entry. The hardest part rather than moment has been applying what ive learnt rather than diving deeper and deeper into interesting topics

### What is OOP?
Object Oriented Programming, classes and objects

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
I found it a little tedious since most of it was already taught by Rob in level 4 but I noticed theres some parts that will be helpful or interesting to read, I havnt read those ones yet because I feel they will distract from the repo assignment and will perhaps be more relevant down the line

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
The parts that were already taught in level 4, like the python intro. Scratch also felt a little tedious like it was a step down but after seeing some other peoples work I get it and its interesting but I dont feel like I learnt anything

### What is polymorphism?
First thought: Being able to see the many facets of something and how it might be applied or being adaptable to a variety of scenarios
Looked it up: I was close!  Its the ability to process objects differently within a programming language depending on their class or data type

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Not really, not a self critical one, maybe ive trained it. It was more of a questioning voice, is this relevant?, do we need to explore this idea now?, should we instead be doing? etc.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
First thought: Most valuable player?
Looked it up: Model-View-Presenter or Minimum Viable Product.. probably the later. I would say.. MVP is when someone asks you what your block city is going to look like and instead of building the whole block city and showing them, you instead put one block where each building would be maybe the block is as tall as you want the finished building to be. The blocks you have put down to show your idea is your MVP

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
I think getting all the different programs to work with each other, VScode Git processing etc.

### What is pair programming?
First thought: When you design a programme that can tell you if a shoe is a left or right shoe and if those shoes are a pair. Or a design practice where a two individuals not part of the same project analyse each others work?
Looked it up: Ohhhh pretty close.. the design practice not the shoes

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
At the moment im hoping we can look into how programmes are packaged, made into an .exe and ways to make a GUI not with tkinter though.. a pretty GUI.
Otherwise I enjoyed the coding challenges 

### What is conscious listening?
Listening conciously, interpreting what the speaker is saying properly. Listening with an empty cup. Active listening

### What is a variable?
something that has a value atributed to it. x = 12, block[red, blue, yellow]

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
SQL: I really enjoyed the database assignment last term
Python: seems smart for employability and has a variety or uses
Javascript: I havnt looked much into it besides using seemingly basic thing with WFC but the stuff it can do in web-design is really exciting
Not deliberately covering most of the course content but those three are truly interesting to me

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
Liam went out of his way to help me understand IP adresses and subnets. My flatmate helped me with my smashed window

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Programming or Coding as an act is when your typing out instructions for software or hardware to follow and perhaps how they might follow those instructions

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
When the assignment was not scenario specific and more focused on what I want I felt doubtful because I dont always feel 'Want' clearly

### What is a fixed mindset?
Unmoving, Inflexible, only able to see one 'facet' or a thing or setting

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
Tried to help others get into the bigBlueButton meeting, passed on what Liam taught me to Jordan, kept a mate company that was going though some health issues

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?
I think so? It wouldnt hurt to do more

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
Yes I think so, I dont have an issue with perseverance but I do with distraction in a "ohh a shiny new topic" sense.
