## Wave Function Collapse
While reading on perlin noise I came across wave function collapse in the context of terrain generators. The best(most informative) two sources for information I found ive listed below.
1. ['Superpositions, Sudoku, the Wave Function Collapse algorithm'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY)
2. ['Why I'm Using Wave Function Collapse for Procedural Terrain | Unity Devlog'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20KHNA9jTsE)

To summarize, WFC (Wave Function Collapse) is pretty much sudoku, it is an algorithm that defines what can be placed next to what by collapsing 'entropy'. for example if we have a blank sudoku board and were to put a 1 in the top left corner then an implementation of WFC could determine that '1' could not be placed any where else in that segment or on the intersecting rows and columns, the entropy has collapsed by one in those boxes. If we were to continue filling out the board with numbers (without error) then as entropy collapses across the board we may eventually end up with only one possible solution to the once blank sudoku board, this would mean each box would only have an entropy of 1, or only one possible number and the algorithm could fill that out for us. The videos above also indicate several other applications of WFC regarding meshes, tilesets and map/terrain generation.

## Applciation
I think it would be a good exercise to use this to create a simple sudoku game, I imagine it would run like this.
1. define/create an empty sudoku grid
2. define sudoku rules (I think this would be done by defining values to numbers and 'passing'(?) that through the WFC algorithm)
3. randomly place numbers on the grid according to defined rules (quantity decided by diffuclty level perhaps) 
4. allow the player to begin entering numbers 
    * if player places a number that does match rules --> mark tile as correct
    * if player places a number that does not match rules (e.g. two '1s' in a single segment) --> mark tile as incorrect
5. player presses a 'submit' button
    * if the grid conforms to rules (and is contains no null tiles) --> the player is congratulated
    * if the grid does not conform to rules --> the play is told they are incorrect
    * if grid contains null tiles --> play asked to fill all tiles and null tiles highlighted

        ### Additons
        1. player may press a 'hint' button to show offending tiles --> tiles recorded as incorrect are highlighted in red
        2. player may press an 'undo' button --> previous tile entry is undone
            * option 1: previous tile is changed to null (tile entry: 1 --> 2 --> 'undo' --> 'null')
            * option 2: frame is saved on entry, undo button reverts to previous frame (tile entry: 1 --> 2 --> 'undo' --> 1)
        3. rules/values for difficulty levels defined

It would be pretty interesting to try having this played in a command terminal. one of the [course articles](https://cpp.iqualify.com/assets/fp-resources/2FFuKM2LTpaR3vj73Ld7) for software devlopment showed a game over screen written in python..

# Where to Start
Im not sure where exactly to start for this, before even looking into implimenting WFC or making a playable sudoku grid I need to create a window or learn how to display the game in terminal if I go with the terminal idea. After hunting on the internet I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V3BnBeFmLs) on youtube which shows how Abdullah created a a space invader type game for terminal but prior to that he created a game engine. Im not sure that a whole game engine is neccesary, I just need to be able to met these requirements
    1. highlight a tile or 'character'
    2. determine what characters are highlightable (cannot highlight borders or move 'highlighter' beyond outer borders)
    3. determine what can be entered into those highlightable tiles (1-9 or ' ')
    3. bind keys to functions (R to reset, Q to quit)
Im going to follow along with Abdullah as he creates his game engine 'Tergie' and keep it along with notes in the 'myCodeStudies/tergie' folder.
