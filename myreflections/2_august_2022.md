# Entagled
Roman Mitch, my lecturer for software development, mentioned during the week two lecture of a paper written by Neri Oxman titled 'The Age of Entanglement'.

In 'The Age of Entanglement' Neri brings to our attention the entagled nature of our modern disciplines..

"The goal (of this essay) is to establish a tentative, yet holistic, cartography of the interrelation between these domains, where one realm can incite (r)evolution inside another; and where a single individual or project can reside in multiple dominions. Mostly, this is an invitation to question and to amend what is being proposed."

Neri discusses the [Krebs cycle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle) (or citric acid cycle), a process where energy is created in the body through chemical reactions, and associates it with John Maedas' 'Bermuda Quadrilateral'. The association Neri makes between the two, she outlines in the below diagram.

After reading Neris' essay I thought to reflect on it, In the context of software development and the approach i might take, would make for a good first journal entry.

The diagram of the krebs cycle of creativity is described by Neri as holistic, I think to keep it in mind in most aspects of my life will help me to maintain a healthy mindset. I find it easy to burn out or feel lost when carrying out tasks (specifically creative tasks) based on my knowledge of something, I think out of fear of failure or inadequcy. To relate this back to the diagram my difficulty is in moving from information to utility.

While i dont expect that Neris essay will be the sole pillar in me building a more productive mindset it could certainly end up part of the formwork by giving me a visual representation of my ideas residing in a (krebs)cycle and in how, if they were to complete that cycle, they would better contribute to further ideas. Moving perceptive behaviour to productive behaviour.. the scenic way.

I think the most thought provoking part of having read 'The Age of Entaglement' was the subsequent articles I read on Neri Oxmans projects. Its hard to tell all the mediums involved in her works particularly in Vespers but she mentions simulations several times. Ild like to at somepoint build/design a simulation myself, what better way to experiment with moving from perception to production to perception then by having created something where the visual output is possibly directly inspiring the form of another work.. like lighting a match and finding inspiration in the flame

Past Neris essay I looked into some of her works. Truly she is working with all four segments of the 'Quadrilateral' she explored in her essay. Below for later inspiration are links I found inspiring
