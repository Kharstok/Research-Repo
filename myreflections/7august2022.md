# Looking back, Moving forward
## Reading the Map
Before this entry I want to substantiate(?(not the word of the day theres surely a better word)) my aims for this repository by typing this small preface. In the previous entry I mentioned my concerns around the repository becoming closer to a journal, I want to address that now in hopes that future entries will be better structured and the purpose clear.
The assignment details say that the repositry is to be..
1. A collection of my own code
2. .. code that has inspired me (including comments)
3.'things' that ive found interesting or dont understand (and so have further investigated)
Im confident that I am currently meeting 2/3 of those requirements (with my own code to be documented later) and will continue to in my entries.

The marking rubric then goes on to list these requirements for full marks..
1. Research and Exploration
    * Proposes, Develops and Sustains a range of ideas,
    * ..with specific processes and methods, that support the development of my own programming practices or project outcomes.
    * Extends informed ideas and practices into the established theory practice and processes of others

I think that this is and will continue to be met although it is a reminder that I should be open to pulling code in github and forking it, applying my own ideas on to pre-existing code. I should also try to continue trains of thought and not leave dead end investigations, as I am prone to.

2. Analysis and Evaluation
    * Appplies and Integrates comprehensive depth of knowledge and understanding of appropriate principals and processes of the subject specialism through the production outcomes.

No problem there, just a reminder to apply the research as well as the methods, processes and principals explored as opposed to exploring them and providing no outcome or integration.

3. Application of Knowledge and Understanding
    * Exactly the same as above?
    * The 'good' level, as opposed to excellent, in the Analysis and Evaluation says "analyses and evaluates own creative research outcomes to form a stated intention/purpose or to fulfill a project brief. Contributes with peers to critically evaluate the qualities or creative ouitsomes produced in response to a set ptoject brief or independant practice (own or others)"

requirements 2 and 3 (despite some possible format errors?) seem to lean more towards the resulting project development assignment rather than the research repository specifically, it doesnt impact my structuring of this repo for now but it does tell me I need to ensure other people are involved in my project (perhaps through testing, trialing or other activites that would give both me and my peers a chance to offer different views on each others work)

## Paving the Road
After going through the requirements Its been of minimal help for the 'right' way to lay out my entries so instead I will lay out my own goals and affirmations for this repository, like i mentioned i think its important to do this now to keep things structured and to keep a healthy mindset.
