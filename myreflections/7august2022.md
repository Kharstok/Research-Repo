# Looking back, Moving forward
## Reading the Map
Before continuing I want to substantiate(?(not the word of the day, theres surely a better word)) my aims for this repository by addressing concerns I had for myself in the previous entry, around the repository becoming closer to a journal, I want to address this now in hopes that future entries will be better structured and more clear both in reading and for myself.
The assignment details say that the repositry is to be..
1. A collection of my own code
2. .. code that has inspired me (including comments)
3.'things' that ive found interesting or dont understand (and so have further investigated)
Im confident that I am currently meeting 2/3 of those requirements (with my own code to be documented later) and will continue to in my entries.

The marking rubric then goes on to list these requirements for full marks..
1. Research and Exploration
    * Proposes, Develops and Sustains a range of ideas,
    * ..with specific processes and methods, that support the development of my own programming practices or project outcomes.
    * Extends informed ideas and practices into the established theory practice and processes of others

I think that this is and will continue to be met although it is a reminder that I should be open to pulling code in github and forking it, applying my own ideas on to pre-existing code. I should also try to continue trains of thought and not leave dead end investigations, as I am prone to.

2. Analysis and Evaluation
    * Appplies and Integrates comprehensive depth of knowledge and understanding of appropriate principals and processes of the subject specialism through the production outcomes.

No problem there, just a reminder to apply the research as well as the methods, processes and principals explored as opposed to exploring them and providing no outcome or integration.

3. Application of Knowledge and Understanding
    * Exactly the same as above?
    * The 'good' level, as opposed to excellent, in the Analysis and Evaluation says "analyses and evaluates own creative research outcomes to form a stated intention/purpose or to fulfill a project brief. Contributes with peers to critically evaluate the qualities or creative ouitsomes produced in response to a set ptoject brief or independant practice (own or others)"

requirements 2 and 3 (despite some possible format errors?) seem to lean more towards the resulting project development assignment rather than the research repository specifically, it doesnt impact my structuring of this repo for now but it does tell me I need to ensure other people are involved in my project (perhaps through testing, trialing or other activites that would give both me and my peers a chance to offer different views on each others work)

## Paving the Road
After going through the requirements Its been of minimal help for the 'right' way to lay out my entries so instead I will lay out my own goals and affirmations for this repository, like i mentioned i think its important to do this now to keep things structured and to keep a healthy mindset.

### Goals and Affirmations
1. To document research sources and topics for both current projects and for reference in future projects. I intend to do this in a way that remains focused on the task at hand while also opening the door to 'branching topics' that may be investigated at a later time
2. To document my insights, questions and curiosities surrounding the reasearch, for both current and future reflection
3. Explore, Analyse, Develop, Apply, Sustain 
4. I give myself permission to take note of my headspace and mindset during the research particularly in regard to creativity, I acknowledge that creative expression can have a negative impact on my wellbeing but that the solution is found in action not avoidance. Personalising this repository does not take away its value in developing my abilities in software development or in creative practice
