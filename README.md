Welcome to my repository! <br>
This landing file will outline the structure and content.<br>
<br>

1. ## myCodeStudies
    1. ### ClassPracticals
        - Contains the python koans accompnied by 'MyKoanWorkings' and 'MyKoanTests' where new code has been written or tests of existing code has been carried out. These files contain several notes and reflections on the challenges and discoveries made while working through Koans.
    2. ### perlinNoise1
        - An exploration of perlin noise generation. The code itself was written via a tutorial and the output experimented with. 
    3. ### tergie
        - The tergie file was written via tutorial when following along a video desicribed in MyReflections/10august2022.md <br>
        It is not, as a whole, working code. Instead I plan to refer to the code if needed for inspiraion or guidance when making the sudoku game. It also served as a good immersive look into how classes and their attributes can be structured.
    4. ### WFC
        - An exploration into 'Wave Function Collapse' again, following along a tutorial. This code is reflected on and length in the majority of my reflections and will be the main inspiration for my final project. The final project will use wave function collapse in an entirely different context but will be inspired by the lessons learnt through writing this code, the error correcting from my mistakes in typing, and the solutions found for displaying the output correctly (via browser)
        - Its the WFC.js file where stuff and things are kept
    5. ### terminal.py
        - My own code but with great assistance from a variety of, now forgotten, sites. It was intended to be practice for printing ascii art or generations into the terminal
