# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
    Scratch is a visual programing language developed by MIT (Massachussets Institute of Technology) it was initially aimed at school children but it looks as though it has been adopted by all ages 
### What is visual programming?
    Visual programming is when the creation/coding process is done through a GUI that enables the user to represent things visually, scratchs coding 'blocks' are an example. Wordpress could be considered visual programming software when compared to writing raw html or css.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
    Im not sure if im interpreting the question right but by programming principals are we talking about rules or guidelines to consider? if true then I list them below.

    1. Keep it Simple, Stupid
        * Code should be easily read and easy to maintain in the future, if its unnecesarily complex consdier breaking things into smaller chunks of code or investigating if some elements are unnecessary and able to be removed.

    2. Contents for Context
        * In level 4 web design I frequently ran into issues with naming classes too similarly as well as loosing track of a growing number of containers. I began thinking of the HTML and CSSS code I was writing as a contents page at the front of a book. Thinking in this context helped me to write code as if it were going from chapter to section, subsection and what page im on.

    3. Comments on Deletion
        * Rather than delete code, wether its to try an alternative or because its not working, comment it out first and keep it commented out until the issue is resolving or the goal reached. Doing this means there is something to fall back on if the alternative didnt work, you will always have something to reference and 'debug'
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
    I made [this one](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717573899/) in class. Its a bit rough, theres no win condition but im happy with what I could do with Sratch. I thought it was a bit too simple but I enjoyed the challenge of converting functions i know in python into something I can use with Scratch. This [generator project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/416842874/) that I found completely debunked my assumptions on scratch

## Week 2:

### What is git?
    Git is a version control system. Git thinks about the data it stores as a series of snapshots which is apprently different to to other VCSs which stores information as files and on changes made to those files over time
### What is GitHub?
    Github is a web hosting service for version control with Git, a software development tool and a community for developers to share and build upon projects by both themselves and others
